# Hackathon frontend template
Basic UI to get you up and running as soon as possible. For documentation, see also the [template documentation](https://demos.creative-tim.com/now-ui-kit-react/#/documentation/introduction).

# Requirements
* NodeJS (tested on `v16.15.1`)
* Optional, but preferred: Yarn (`npm install --global yarn`)

# Getting started
```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

The development server will be available on `localhost:3000`.

# Docker
You can host the app on a Docker container by running `yarn docker:run`. It'll build the app through `yarn build` and run it on a simple Nginx instance.
